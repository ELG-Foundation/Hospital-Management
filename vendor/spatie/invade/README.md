We invest a lot of resources into creating [best in class open source packages](https://spatie.be/open-source). You can support us by [buying one of our paid products](https://spatie.be/open-source/support-us).

We highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using. You'll find our address on [our contact page](https://spatie.be/about-us). We publish all received postcards on [our virtual postcard wall](https://spatie.be/open-source/postcards).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/invade
```

## Usage

Imagine you have this class defined which has a private property and method.

```php
class MyClass
{
    private string $privateProperty = 'private value';

    private function privateMethod(): string
    {
        return 'private return value';
    }
}

$myClass = new Myclass();
```

This is how you can get the value of the private property using the `invade` function.

```php
invade($myClass)->privateProperty; // returns 'private value'
```

The `invade` function also allows you to change private values.

```php
invade($myClass)->privateProperty = 'changed value';
invade($myClass)->privateProperty; // returns 'changed value
```

Using `invade` you can also call private functions.

```php
invade($myClass)->privateMethod(); // returns 'private return value'
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
