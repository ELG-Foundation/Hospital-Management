title: Configuration
---

## Overview

By default, the configuration file is located at `app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php`. Keep reading to learn more about [panels](#introducing-panels) and how each has [its own configuration file](#creating-a-new-panel).

## Introducing panels

By default, when you install the package, there is one panel that has been set up for you - and it lives on `/admin`. All the [resources](resources/getting-started), [pages](pages), and [dashboard widgets](dashboard) you create get registered to this panel.

However, you can create as many panels as you want, and each can have its own set of resources, pages and widgets.

For example, you could build a panel where users can log in at `/app` and access their dashboard, and admins can log in at `/admin` and manage the app. The `/app` panel and the `/admin` panel have their own resources, since each group of users has different requirements. Filament allows you to do that by providing you with the ability to create multiple panels.

### The default admin panel

When you run `filament:install`, a new file is created in `app/Providers/Filament` - `AdminPanelProvider.php`. This file contains the configuration for the `/admin` panel.

When this documentation refers to the "configuration", this is the file you need to edit. It allows you to completely customize the app.

### Creating a new panel

To create a new panel, you can use the `make:filament-panel` command, passing in the unique name of the new panel:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-panel app
```

This command will create a new panel called "app". A configuration file will be created at `app/Providers/Filament/AppPanelProvider.php`. You can access this panel at `/app`, but you can [customize the path](#changing-the-path) if you don't want that.

Since this configuration file is also a [Laravel service provider](https://laravel.com/docs/providers), it needs to be registered in `config/app.php`. Filament will attempt to do this for you, but if you get an error while trying to access your panel then this process has probably failed. You can manually register the service provider by adding it to the `providers` array.

## Changing the path

In a panel configuration file, you can change the path that the app is accessible at using the `path()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->path('app');
}
```

If you want the app to be accessible without any prefix, you can set this to be an empty string:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->path('');
}
```

Make sure your `routes/web.php` file doesn't already define the `''` or `'/'` route, as it will take precedence.

## Render hooks

[Render hooks](../support/render-hooks) allow you to render Blade content at various points in the framework views. You can [register global render hooks](../support/render-hooks#registering-render-hooks) in a service provider or middleware, but it also allows you to register render hooks that are specific to a panel. To do that, you can use the `renderHook()` method on the panel configuration object. Here's an example, integrating [`wire-elements/modal`](https://github.com/wire-elements/modal) with Filament:

```php
use Filament\Panel;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Blade;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->renderHook(
            'panels::body.start',
            fn (): string => Blade::render('@livewire(\'livewire-ui-modal\')'),
        );
}
```

A full list of available render hooks can be found [here](../support/render-hooks#available-render-hooks).

## Setting a domain

By default, Filament will respond to requests from all domains. If you'd like to scope it to a specific domain, you can use the `domain()` method, similar to [`Route::domain()` in Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/routing#route-group-subdomain-routing):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->domain('admin.example.com');
}
```

## Customizing the maximum content width

By default, Filament will restrict the width of the content on a page, so it doesn't become too wide on large screens. To change this, you may use the `maxContentWidth()` method. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`, `3xl`, `4xl`, `5xl`, `6xl`, `7xl`, `prose`, `screen-sm`, `screen-md`, `screen-lg`, `screen-xl`, `screen-2xl` and `full`. The default is `7xl`:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->maxContentWidth('full');
}
```

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code during a panel's lifecycle. `bootUsing()` is a hook that gets run on every request that takes place within that panel. If you have multiple panels, only the current panel's `bootUsing()` will be run. The function gets run from middleware, after all service providers have been booted:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->bootUsing(function (Panel $panel) {
            // ...
        });
}
```

## SPA mode

> Warning: This feature is experimental, and you may encounter bugs while using it. Please report any issues you find to [Livewire](https://github.com/livewire/livewire) with a pull request containing a failing test.

SPA mode utilizes [Livewire's `wire:navigate` feature](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/navigate) to make your server-rendered panel feel like a single-page-application, with less delay between page loads and a loading bar for longer requests. To enable SPA mode on a panel, you can use the `spa()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->spa();
}
```
